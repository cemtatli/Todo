<p>Welcome to the "Todo" repository. </p>

<h3>Why todo list is important ?</h3>
<p>A to-do list is important because it provides a way to prioritize tasks, track progress, and increase productivity and organization. It helps to clarify goals, minimize distractions, and ensure that nothing important is forgotten. By regularly reviewing and updating the list, one can stay focused on what needs to be accomplished, stay motivated, and ultimately achieve more in a day.</p>
